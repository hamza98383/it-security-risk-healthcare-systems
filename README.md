# 🛡️ IT Security and Risk – Healthcare Systems

A comprehensive research report analyzing vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies in AI-powered diagnostic healthcare systems.

---

## 📌 Research Overview

This project investigates the security risks associated with Machine Learning (ML) models used in medical imaging, such as X-ray, CT, and MRI. As AI becomes more integrated into healthcare diagnostics, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of these systems is critical for patient safety and regulatory compliance.

### 🔍 Key Research Areas
* **Vulnerability Analysis:** Investigated critical threats including data poisoning, model inversion, and adversarial attacks on healthcare diagnostic systems.
* **Mitigation Strategies:** Explored advanced defenses such as adversarial training, gradient masking, and the use of Swish activation functions.
* **Security Frameworks:** Applied industry standards including NIST, ISO 27001, and CIS Controls to audit system reliability.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** Analyzed adherence to GDPR to protect sensitive patient data in clinical settings.
